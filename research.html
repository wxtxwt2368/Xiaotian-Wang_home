    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborative Research Design and Experimentation: Engaged in collaborative efforts with faculty and researchers to formulate research plans and design experiments aimed at achieving specific research objectives. My contributions span a broad range of areas including the growth and application of Carbon Nanotubes, the development of flexible batteries, the fabrication of microfluidic platforms and biosensors, as well as the creation of electronic and photonic devices and energy harvesting systems.</li>
        <li>Advancing Nano-/Microfabrication Techniques: Proficient in an array of fabrication processes both within and external to cleanroom environments. Expertise encompasses: Photolithography, Laser Writing, E-beam Lithography, Physical Vapor Deposition, Chemical Vapor Deposition (including Low Pressure (LPCVD) and Atmospheric Pressure (APCVD) techniques), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, Wet Etching, Dry Etching (ICP-RIE, Plasma Asher), Nanoimprint, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Focused ion beam (FIB), Raman Spectroscopy and Photoluminescence, Surface Metrology (profilometers).</li>
        <li>Advancing Synthesis and Characterization of 2D Materials: Specializing in the synthesis, modification, transfer, post-synthesis processing, and comprehensive characterization of 2D materials, such as Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs), with a focus on exploring their innovative applications and properties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Location-Specific Synthesis of TMDs:</b> Innovative processes for synthesizing TMDs with precise control.</li>
        <li><b>Photoluminescence Studies:</b> Studies on the transfer and properties of 2D materials.</li>
    </ul>
